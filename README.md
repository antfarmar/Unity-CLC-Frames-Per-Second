# Frames Per Second: Measuring Performance

_Catlike Coding Unity C# Tutorial:_ http://catlikecoding.com/unity/tutorials/frames-per-second/

### Description

In this tutorial we'll create a simple test scene and then measure its performance.
We'll first examine the profiler, then we'll create our own frame rate counter.

- Use physics to create an ever-growing atomic nucleus.
- Use the profiler to investigate performance.
- Measure and display the frame rate.
- Prevent the creation of temporary strings.
- Stabilize the frame rate by averaging multiple frames.
- Colorize the frame rate display.
